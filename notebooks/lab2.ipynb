    "In this week's lab, you will understand what's behind the [Baxter robot](http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/) (Figure 1) simulation and how its kinematic transformations are maintained. The Baxter robot is an industrial robot built by Rethink Robotics. It has two arms and was intended for use in manufacturing production lines. The Baxter robot can learn how to do a task through someone moving the robot’s arms in the desired motion. It will memorise the action and be able to repeat it. This ‘muscle memory’ ability allows Baxter to be programmed by any regular person and makes it fast and straightforward to use. Hence, you will:\n",

    "## Coordinate Transforms in ROS\n",
    "As in the lecture, coordinate frame transformations are fundamental to robotics. For articulated robot arms, you can deduce the forward and inverse kinematics to compute gripper poses as a function of joint angles or vice-versa. This is possible by multiplying sequential transforms describing the current state of a robot. Sensor data, e.g. from cameras, can be merged into the robot's coordinate frame, and this data must be interpreted in terms of alternative frames (e.g. world frame or robot frame) to allow a robot to perceive and act within an environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "ROS provides a powerful package for handling, maintaining and updating these transformations. This package is [tf](http://wiki.ros.org/tf) and offers command-line tools for inspecting transformations of a robot. This package also provides APIs in ROS's supported programming languages to manipulate and plan movements with robots. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, let's start Gazebo (ROS simulation from the previous lab) and bring up a robot (Baxter) by typing in a terminal:\n",

    "cd ~/ros_ws\n",

    "This topic uses messages of type [tf2_msgs/TFMessage](http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/tf2_msgs/html/msg/TFMessage.html) which consists of a variable length array of a [stamped transform](http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TransformStamped.html). ROS does not employ the homogenous 4-by-4 matrix representation covered in the lecture but uses a 3-D vector (equivalent to the forth column of a 4-by-4 transform) and a [quaternion](http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/algebra/realNormedAlgebra/quaternions/) (an alternative representation of orientation). This data structure is more efficient to carry pose information than the homogenous matrix representation, e.g. homogenous transformations need 12 floating point numbers (16 numbers but the last row is always a row vector with the 4th entry equal to 1) as opposed to 7 floating point numbers when using quaternions. Also, transform messages have timestamps, and they explicitly name the child frame and the parent frame (as text strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "In ROS, orientations are commonly expressed as unit quaternions. The quaternion representation is an alternative to rotation matrices, have powerful mathematical properties, and avoid several problems while using homogeneous transformations and Euler angles. **However, you do not need to worry about quaternions as it is outside the scope of this course. TF provides functions to transform quaternions into Euler angles and even homogenous transformations!** At this point, it is sufficient to know that there is a correspondence between quaternions and rotation matrices (and ROS functions to perform such conversions will be introduced later) and that there are corresponding mathematical operations for coordinate transformations with quaternions.\n",

    "how a child frame is spatially related to its parent frame. A parent can have multiple children, but a child must have a unique parent, thus generating a tree of geometric relationships with respect to this parent frame. In ROS, you can create a `tf_listener` which is typically started as an independent thread. This thread subscribes to the `tf` topic and assembles a kinematic tree from individual parent-child transform messages. Since the `tf_listener` incorporates all transformations, it can address specific queries, such as *where is Baxter's right-hand\n",
    "finger frame relative to Baxter's head?”* The reply of this query is a transform message that can be used to reconcile different frames.
